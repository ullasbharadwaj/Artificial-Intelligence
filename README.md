# Artificial Intelligence

This repository holds interesting Machine Learning and Deep Learning Projects which were carried out for the purpose of 
learning and passion to understand the Deep Learning cocepts hands-on.

1. Text Generation  
   A LSTM based DNN is trained on an input file to learn generating artificial texts.
   
2. Fake Image Generation  
   A WGAN based DNN is used to generate cool fake images such as cartoons or human faces.
